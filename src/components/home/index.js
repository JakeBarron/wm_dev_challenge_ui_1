        I opted to go with a React frontend styled with a React Bootstrap
        implementation called reactstrap.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided I would be able to showcase my frontend knowledge in a bit
        more of an ostentatious way via React instead of Angular. I am excited
        to learn more Angular very soon!
